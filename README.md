# ContactListApp
A small Contact List App, which lets you add new contacts as Name, email and phone number. You can also delete a certain contact and edit a certain contact.

**How to start the app**

After you have downloaded the app, follow these steps:
- Enter into terminal after you are in the folder where the "server.js" lies.
```
node server
```
- Open in your browser **localhost:3000** 

**Small Issues Yet to Resolved:**

- The contact which is being updated, can also be added as "New contact".
- There is no validations of emails and phone numbers yet.
- No confirmation before deleting a contact.
